Description
===========

This model provides reusable components for
compsing a pier. Mainly these are:
- Masonery blocks for extending a pier into
  one or two directions
- Poles to support the pier
- Pier with wide and narrow support beams,
  so they are "pluggable"
  
The texture images used were partially provided
by Doug Turner.
